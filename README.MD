## Running locally

You'll need a personal [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API key.

After obtaining one, create a file called `.env` in the root of your `projectâ€™s directory.`

Inside the `.env file`, prepend `API_KEY` to `your api key` provided by OpenWeatherMap and assign it as follows:
<br/><br/>

>*API_KEY=your_api_key*

`please enter your key without quotes.`
<br/><br/>

Now you can run server.js by typing

```
node server.js
```

or by typing
```
nodemon server.js
```
if you're using nodemon.
